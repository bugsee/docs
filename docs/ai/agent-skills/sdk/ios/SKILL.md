# Bugsee iOS SDK

Opinionated wizard that scans your iOS project and guides you through complete Bugsee setup — bug reporting with video, crash reporting, network monitoring, console logs, APM, and optional build size analysis.

Current stable pin (re-verified 2026-10-08 against the SPM tags and CocoaPods trunk; matches the [6.x release notes](https://docs.bugsee.com/sdk/ios/release-notes/)):

- **SPM** tag `6.3.2` at `https://github.com/bugsee/spm`
- **CocoaPods** trunk pod `Bugsee` `6.3.2`
- **Carthage** binary catalog also lists `6.3.2`

> **Note:** Always verify against [docs.bugsee.com/sdk/ios/installation/](https://docs.bugsee.com/sdk/ios/installation/) before implementing. Prefer registry tags over the release-notes page when they disagree.

> **7.x is in beta — do not install it unless the user explicitly asks.** Latest SPM tag is `7.0.0-beta5` (also beta1–beta4) on `https://github.com/bugsee/spm`; `https://github.com/bugsee/feedback-spm` has matching tags. The [7.x release notes](https://docs.bugsee.com/sdk/ios/v7/release-notes/), [installation](https://docs.bugsee.com/sdk/ios/v7/installation/), and [migration guide](https://docs.bugsee.com/sdk/ios/v7/migration/) now document through **beta5** (checked 2026-10-08). This skill targets **6.x**; for a 7.x beta follow those pages rather than the 6.x code below. Pin both packages with the **Exact Version** rule at the **same** tag (`7.0.0-beta5`) — SPM keeps pre-releases out of version ranges, so "Up to Next Major" from 6.3.2 never resolves a 7.x beta.
>
> 7.x is a breaking line. Agent-relevant facts now on docs.bugsee.com:
> - **Minimum is iOS 15 / tvOS 15** (raised in beta2; beta1's iOS 13 / tvOS 13 floor is obsolete). visionOS 1 unchanged. SPM is the only channel (CocoaPods and Carthage retired).
> - Every option constant is renamed into the `BugseeOption*` family (hard-coded strings silently fall back to defaults). `pause`/`resume` and several other methods are removed or renamed.
> - Feedback is a separate package: add `https://github.com/bugsee/feedback-spm` at the same Exact Version as core. Each `BugseeFeedback` release requires that core version exactly.
> - Nine defaults changed. The ninth (beta3): `BugseeOptionCaptureMachExceptions` is **YES** on iOS and visionOS (set `NO` for BSD signal handlers; tvOS always uses BSD).
> - Every `BugseeDelegate` method has a new Swift name ([migration §4.6](https://docs.bugsee.com/sdk/ios/v7/migration/)). A 6.x-named Swift implementation compiles but is **never called**.
> - The `BugseeReport` passed to the delegate is a live handle — mutations are what gets uploaded (`type` is read-only; no public initializer; do not keep it past the callback).
> - `addSecureRectangle:` drops touches as well as pixels. Multi-window recording (beta4) records every window on screen; convert rectangles to screen coordinates.
> - `log:level:enforceFiltering:` is renamed `log:level:requiresFiltering:`.

## Invoke This Skill When

- User asks to "add Bugsee to iOS" or "set up Bugsee" in an iOS/iPadOS app
- User wants bug reporting, crash reporting, video recording, network monitoring, APM, or build size analysis in iOS
- User mentions Bugsee CocoaPods, Bugsee SPM, Bugsee Carthage, or Bugsee for Swift/Objective-C

---

## Phase 1: Detect

Run these commands to understand the project:

```bash
# Detect Xcode project
ls *.xcodeproj *.xcworkspace 2>/dev/null

# Detect Swift vs Objective-C
find . -name "*.swift" -not -path "*/Pods/*" -not -path "*/.build/*" 2>/dev/null | head -5
find . -name "*.m" -not -path "*/Pods/*" 2>/dev/null | head -5

# Detect dependency manager
ls Podfile Package.swift Cartfile 2>/dev/null

# Check for existing Bugsee
grep -ri bugsee Podfile Package.swift Cartfile 2>/dev/null | head -5

# Find AppDelegate
find . -name "AppDelegate.swift" -o -name "AppDelegate.m" 2>/dev/null | head -3

# Detect SwiftUI App lifecycle (no AppDelegate)
grep -r "@main" --include="*.swift" 2>/dev/null | head -3
```

| Question | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| `Package.swift` exists or SPM? | Prefer Swift Package Manager (recommended going forward) |
| `Cartfile` exists? | Use Carthage installation |
| `Podfile` exists? | CocoaPods still works for existing projects; see the CocoaPods note below |
| No dependency manager? | Use manual framework installation |
| Swift files found? | Show Swift init code |
| Objective-C files found? | Show Objective-C init code |
| `AppDelegate` found? | Add `Bugsee.launch()` there |
| SwiftUI `@main` lifecycle? | See [SwiftUI docs](https://docs.bugsee.com/sdk/ios/swiftui/) |
| Already has Bugsee? | Skip install, check initialization |

---

## Phase 2: Install

Choose one method based on the detected dependency manager. **Prefer SPM or Carthage for new installs.** CocoaPods trunk is scheduled to become read-only on **December 2, 2026** (test window November 1–7, 2026 per [the CocoaPods blog](https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Specs-Repo/)); existing Pod installs and the CDN continue to work. Keep the CocoaPods path for existing `Podfile` projects (6.3.2 is already on trunk).

### Swift Package Manager (recommended)

Add the package in Xcode:
1. File > Add Package Dependencies
2. Enter URL: `https://github.com/bugsee/spm`
3. Select version **6.3.2** (latest tag) and add it to the app target

### Carthage

Add to `Cartfile`:

```
binary "https://download.bugsee.com/sdk/ios/dynamic/Bugsee.json"
```

Then run:

```bash
carthage update --use-xcframeworks
```

Drag `Bugsee.xcframework` from `Carthage/Build` into your target's "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content".

### CocoaPods (existing Podfile projects)

CocoaPods trunk is scheduled to become read-only on **December 2, 2026** (test window November 1–7, 2026). Existing Pod installs and the CDN continue to work; only new Podspec publishes stop. Prefer SPM or Carthage for new integrations. If the project already uses CocoaPods, add to `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Bugsee', '6.3.2'
```

Then run:

```bash
pod install
pod update Bugsee   # install alone does not guarantee the latest trunk version
```

### Manual

1. Download from [https://download.bugsee.com/sdk/ios/dynamic/Bugsee-stable.xcframework.zip](https://download.bugsee.com/sdk/ios/dynamic/Bugsee-stable.xcframework.zip)
2. Extract and drag `Bugsee.xcframework` into your Xcode project
3. Ensure "Embed & Sign" is selected in target settings

---

## Phase 3: Initialize

Add Bugsee launch to your AppDelegate:

**Swift:**

```swift
import Bugsee

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // ...other initialization code

    Bugsee.launch(token: "<your_app_token>")

    return true
}
```

**Objective-C:**

```objectivec
@import Bugsee;

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    // ...other initialization code

    [Bugsee launchWithToken:@"<your_app_token>"];

    return YES;
}
```

> Replace `<your_app_token>` with the token from your Bugsee dashboard.

> Since v6.0.0 the Bugsee iOS SDK supports the simulator; crash capture is excluded. For full functionality, use a real device.

---

## Phase 4: Configure (Optional)

Launch with options for customization:

**Swift:**

```swift
let options = BugseeOptions()
options.shakeToReport = true
options.reportPrioritySelector = true
options.maxRecordingTime = 60
options.captureVideoAdaptive = true          // 6.3.0 — lower FPS on idle UI
options.performanceMonitoring = true         // 6.2.0 — APM (default YES)
options.sanitizeNetworkData = true           // 6.1.3 — PII redaction (default YES)
Bugsee.launch(token: "<your_app_token>", options: options)
```

**Objective-C:**

```objectivec
BugseeOptions *options = [[BugseeOptions alloc] init];
options.shakeToReport = YES;
options.reportPrioritySelector = YES;
options.maxRecordingTime = 60;
options.captureVideoAdaptive = YES;
options.performanceMonitoring = YES;
options.sanitizeNetworkData = YES;
[Bugsee launchWithToken:@"<your_app_token>" options:options];
```

Dictionary-key equivalents (same names as on the [configuration](https://docs.bugsee.com/sdk/ios/configuration/) page): `BugseeCaptureVideoAdaptiveKey` (`"CaptureVideoAdaptive"`), `BugseePerformanceMonitoringKey` (`performanceMonitoring`), `BugseeSanitizeNetworkDataKey` (`sanitizeNetworkData`). The configuration page may lag the 6.3.2 headers; the keys above are in the current SDK.

Common options:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `videoEnabled` | `true` | Enable video recording |
| `crashReport` | `true` | Catch and report crashes |
| `monitorNetwork` | `true` | Capture network traffic |
| `sanitizeNetworkData` | `true` | Auto-redact known PII keys from captured network events (6.1.3). Applies only when no custom network filter is set. |
| `captureLogs` | `true` | Capture console logs |
| `captureOSLogs` | `false` | **No effect since 6.3.2** — `os_log` / `Logger` capture was permanently disabled (it polled the log store all session). Still compiles; do not enable it expecting output. Use `Bugsee.log(...)` or `NSLog` for logs you want captured. |
| `maxRecordingTime` | `60` | Max recording duration (seconds) |
| `shakeToReport` | `false` | Shake device to trigger report |
| `screenshotEnabled` | `true` | Attach screenshot to report |
| `wifiOnlyUpload` | `false` | Upload only on WiFi |
| `captureVideoAdaptive` | `false` | Opt-in adaptive screen capture (6.3.0): ~1 fps on a static screen, ramps to `maxFramerate` on visual activity |
| `performanceMonitoring` | `true` | APM master switch (6.2.0). When `false`, `startTransaction` / `startSpan` return a shared no-op |

Full options: [docs.bugsee.com/sdk/ios/configuration/](https://docs.bugsee.com/sdk/ios/configuration/)

### APM (`startTransaction` / `startSpan`) — 6.2.0+

Auto-instruments NSURLSession HTTP, NSData file I/O, NSFileManager operations, UIViewController lifecycle, and app startup. Transactions are attached to every report. SwiftUI auto-instrumentation is not in 6.3.2 yet.

**Swift:**

```swift
let tx = Bugsee.startTransaction(name: "Checkout", operation: "ui.checkout")
let span = Bugsee.startSpan(operation: "db.query", description: "SELECT cart")
// ... work ...
span.finish()
tx.finish()   // no-arg finish implies SpanStatus.ok
```

**Objective-C:**

```objectivec
id<BGSTransaction> tx = [Bugsee startTransactionWithName:@"Checkout" operation:@"ui.checkout"];
id<BGSSpan> span = [Bugsee startSpanWithOperation:@"db.query" description:@"SELECT cart"];
[span finish];
[tx finishWithStatus:BGSSpanStatusOK];
```

When `performanceMonitoring` is `NO`, both APIs return a shared no-op singleton — no null checks needed. `startSpan` parents to the current active span on the calling thread (pthread TLS; it does not auto-propagate across `dispatch_async`).

### BugseeAgent size analysis — 6.1.5+

The same `BugseeAgent` post-action that uploads dSYMs also registers a build record (version, configuration, VCS context, timings, Mach-O `LC_UUID`). Size analysis is opt-in.

1. Add a Run Script **Archive** post-action (Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme → Archive → Post-actions). Set **Provide build settings from** to the app target.
2. Script body (CocoaPods / manual — locates `BugseeAgent` in the project):

   ```bash
   SCRIPT_SRC=$(find "$PROJECT_DIR" -name 'BugseeAgent' | head -1)
   if [ ! "$SCRIPT_SRC" ]; then
       echo "Error: BugseeAgent not found"
       exit 1
   fi
   python3 "$SCRIPT_SRC" <APP_TOKEN> >> /tmp/BugseeAgent.txt
   ```

   For **SPM**, replace the `find` line with:

   ```bash
   SCRIPT_SRC="$BUILD_DIR/../SourcePackages/checkouts/spm/Tools/BugseeAgent"
   ```

3. `BUGSEE_BUILD_INFO_ENABLED` is **ON by default** — do not set it. To also upload the IPA for download/install size, per-category breakdown, and per-file diffs, add scheme Environment Variables:

   ```text
   BUGSEE_SIZE_ANALYSIS_ENABLED=1
   # optional:
   # BUGSEE_CHUNKED_UPLOAD=1
   # BUGSEE_SIZE_CHECK_ENABLED=1
   # BUGSEE_SIZE_CHECK_WARNING_PCT=5.0
   # BUGSEE_SIZE_CHECK_FAIL_PCT=10.0
   ```

## Verification

After setup, build and run the app on a device. You should see a Bugsee floating button overlay. Tap it to file a test bug report.

Check the Bugsee dashboard for the incoming report.

---

## Debug Symbols

A Release build strips symbols, so crashes arrive as raw addresses until dSYMs are uploaded. Confirm `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT = dwarf-with-dsym` for the Release configuration first — without it there are no dSYMs to upload at all.

Two shapes, both driven by the [Bugsee CLI](https://github.com/bugsee/bugsee-for-ai/blob/main/skills/bugsee-cli/SKILL.md):

- **Scheme post-action** — the SDK's `BugseeAgent` script runs `bugsee-cli xcode post-action` from Archive → Post-actions. Uploads dSYMs *and* registers the build (build info, dependencies, timings, optional size analysis). Gated to Release + Archive by default.
- **Run Script build phase** — `bugsee-cli xcode upload-dsyms` (CLI 0.7.7+) uploads dSYMs alone, with no build registration, so it is safe on every build. A genuine failure fails the build on purpose; `--no-fail --no-background` is the usual CI combination.

> **Xcode 15+:** `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING` defaults to `YES` and blocks a build phase from reading the dSYM folder. Set it to `NO` on the target, or declare the folder in the phase's input file lists.

Full workflow, including manual upload of App Store Connect dSYMs: [`bugsee-upload-symbols`](https://github.com/bugsee/bugsee-for-ai/blob/main/skills/bugsee-upload-symbols/SKILL.md).
